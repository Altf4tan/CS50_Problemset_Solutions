I would characterize their audio aura by their genres for example, death metal genre would have negative aura meanwhile Lo-Fi genre having more positive aura because emotional qualities of most songs cannot be perceived by just raw data from tables.
Instead, using genre can capture more nuanced cultural or emotional contexts (e.g. metal might have different "feel" than electronic music, even if their energies are similar).
